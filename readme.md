# C++
The kindergarden application and some other projects meant to try QT4


**this application was part of our first academic project and it shows code consitency and a good hierarchy design**


## Application
The application folder contains the main app, it's debug and realse needs some QT4 .so files,
we couldn't make it production ready we didn't even finished the whole project.To try it i recommand installing QT Creator open the app in the creator and launch it.
